🎧 Spotify Music Dashboard in Power BI

🚀 Exploring Music Trends with Power BI

This project focuses on analyzing Spotify data to uncover meaningful music trends and patterns using Microsoft Power BI. The entire process — from raw data cleaning to dashboard design — was completed independently to strengthen analytical and technical skills in real-world data handling.

🎵 Project Overview

The goal of this project was to transform raw Spotify data into interactive insights that reveal audience preferences, artist performances, and song popularity patterns. Power BI was used to visualize and interpret how duration, popularity, and album composition affect music trends.

🔍 Key Insights

• Top Artists and their most popular songs
• Average Song Duration and Popularity analysis
• Album-wise Track Distribution
• Overall Artist Performance across metrics

These insights provide a clear view of how various musical elements contribute to overall listener engagement and artist success.

🛠️ Technical Implementation

The workflow was executed entirely in Power BI, combining data transformation and DAX analysis:
• Data Cleaning & Transformation – Conducted in Power Query to handle duplicates, fix inconsistencies, and prepare structured data.
• DAX (Data Analysis Expressions) – Created measures for total songs, average popularity, total duration, and other analytical KPIs.
• Dashboard Design – Developed an interactive dashboard with filters, slicers, and dynamic visuals to explore music data effectively.

📈 Skills Demonstrated

• Data Cleaning and Transformation (Power Query)
• DAX for Analytical Insights and Metrics
• Dashboard Design & Data Visualization

📚 Learning Outcomes

• Cleaning and structuring raw data for analysis
• Applying DAX formulas to derive key insights
• Designing a professional, interactive Power BI dashboard

This project demonstrates strong skills in data analysis, visualization, and storytelling through Power BI — turning raw data into meaningful insights about music trends and artist performance.
